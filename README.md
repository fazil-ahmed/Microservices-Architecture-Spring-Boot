# Microservices-Architecture-Spring-Boot
This repository will have the Microservices architecture implemented using spring boot on master branch

I have established communication between these microservices using Discovery server.
Down the line I will be using docker to deploy these microservices


#Using this branch for local and Docker

If you use this project to learn microservices with local development please change
the application.yml file and application.properties file (the eureka defaultZone to localhost)
